7.Secret Knock detecting door:
  The requirements are Arduino, piezo speaker and a servo motor.
  The peizo speaker takes in sounds of the knock, and the servo motor helps us to open the door.
  Per se, int secretCode[maximumKnocks] = {100, 100, 55, 55, 100, 100, 100, 50, 40, 50, 30};
  then, this is the default knock that it recognizes when you turn it on.
