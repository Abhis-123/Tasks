Arduino DC motor control using L298N:
  
  The circuit is:

  We can control the speed of the motor, with the help of PWM signals from the Arduino.
  
  All we need is 2 DC Motors, the L298N driver, an Arduino board and a joystick for the control. 
  
  As for the power supply, we use three 3.7V Li-ion batteries, providing a total of 11V.
