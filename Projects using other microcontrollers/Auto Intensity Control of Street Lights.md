  The circuit components are ATmega8 micro controller, DS 1307 IC, LDR and a LCD display.
  
  The main principle of this project is to Control the intensity of street lights using PWM.
  
  Peak hours of a particular area are calculated and accordingly PWM signal is adjusted by microcontroller to increase or decrease the intensity of street lights.
  
  By reducing the intensity in these times, energy can be saved to some extent.
