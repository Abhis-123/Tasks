  The circuit can be divided into two units: the microcontroller unit and the seven segment unit. 
  
  The microcontroller unit contains a microcontroller circuit (for microcontroller circuit details, refer ‘led blinking’ section) and the seven segment unit contains a seven segment circuit which is interfaced to the controller (for more details of seven segment circuit, refer ‘seven segment interfacing’ section). 
  
  This circuit displays the numbers from 1 to 6 continuously and it halts at the position user wants and starts again from the same position with the next instruction of the user.
