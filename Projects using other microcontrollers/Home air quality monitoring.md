  This air quality detector not only measures the Carbon Dioxide (CO2) level in the air, but also measures the level of humidity and temperature both inside the room and outside environment.
  
  This project consists temperature, humidity sensor and CO2 sensor. These sensors are attached with the system inside the room to calculate the room temperature, humidity and CO2 and also on the roof of the house to calculate the atmosphere temperature, humidity and CO2.
  
  It also has LCD attached to it which displays the value of the temperature, humidity and CO2 levels measured.
  
  The major hardware requirements are:
  PIC microcontroller, CO2 sensor, temperature sensor, humidity sensor, rectifier, regulator and LCD display.
