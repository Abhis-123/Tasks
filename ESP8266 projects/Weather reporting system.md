IoT weather reporting system:
  
  System uses temperature, humidity as well as rain sensor to monitor weather and provide live reporting of the weather statistics.
  
  The system constantly transmits this data to the microcontroller, which now processes this data and keeps on transmitting it to the online web server over a wifi connection.
