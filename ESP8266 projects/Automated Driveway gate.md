Automated Driveway Gate:

  The requirements are linear actuators, ESP8266 D1-MINI, Motor driver and Linear regulator(7805).
  
  The motor driver is:

  PWM does not have to be connected. The linear actuators to the black screw terminals.
  
  The aim is to make an automated gateway for the driveway. 
  
  This can be done with the help of Blynk, Adafruit or both.
  
  Blynk sends you a notification and has a button for opening the gate. It can work by itself and doesn't need any other services.
  
  Adafruit uploads car data and receives gate data from Adafruit. The Adafruit option is mainly for integrating IFTTT. You can also add Clicksend for integrating sms.
