Social distancing device:

  The requirements are Arduino board, an Ultrasonic sensor and a buzzer.
  
  So, as the name suggests, the device is very simple.
  
  The device starts beeping, when a person comes within a range of 1m.
  
  The ultrasonic sensor detects the person when he/she comes in on closer than a meter, the buzzer gets operated with the help of the Arduino code.
