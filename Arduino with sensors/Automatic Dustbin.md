Automatic Dustbin:

  The requirements are Arduino board, Ultrasonic distance sensor and a servo motor.
  
  So, the waste material is shown in front of the dustbin, wherein there is an Ultrasonic sensor.
  
  So, this sensor detects the material, and as per the Arduino code, the servo motor whose blades are placed on the pedal of the dustbin gets rotated, hence making the lid open.
  
  After sometime, the lid gets closed, when the code moves the servo accordingly.
  
  The Arduino board looks like:
