Arduino Color Sorter:

  The Mechanical model of the Sorter is:

  The requirements are Arduino Nano board, two servo motors, TCS230 TCS3200 Color Sensor, switch and a power jack.
  
  The connections for the sorter is:

  So, there are two servos, let us say they are top and bottom servos.
  
  The top servo helps us to move the coloured pebble from the container to under the color sensor, which detects the color.
  
  Based on the color detected, the bottom servo rotates the guide rail into the box of a particular color.
